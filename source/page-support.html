        <h2>Need Help?</h2>

        <p>If you need some help using Snap.svg, you have a few options:</p>

        <p><b>1. The Docs</b><br>If you haven’t seen the Snap.svg docs yet, <a href="http://snapsvg.io/docs/">that’s the place to start</a>.</p>

        <p><b>2. Our Google Group</b><br>If you've already RTFM, the next step is to head over to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/snapsvg">Snap.svg forums</a> and ask your question there.</p>

        <p><b>3. Twitter</b><br>If you can formulate your question in 140 characters or less, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/Snapsvg">reach out to us on Twitter</a>. Just be aware that the response (including all code) will be equally succinct and cryptic.</p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Found a Bug?</h2>
